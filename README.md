#Infrastructure as Code (IAC) Cookbook
This is the code repository for [Infrastructure as Code (IAC) Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/infrastructure-code-iac-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786464910), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Infrastructure as Code (IAC) is a key aspect of the DevOps movement, and this book will show you how to transform the way you work with your infrastructureâ€”by treating it as software.

This book is dedicated to helping you discover the essentials of infrastructure automation and its related practices; the over 90 organized practical solutions will demonstrate how to work with some of the very best tools and cloud solutions.


##Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
 # all your Vagrant configuration here
end
```

The essential requirement is a computer capable of running a Linux virtual machine and an
Internet connection. The author's computers are laptops running Mac OS 10.11 and Fedora
25, with VirtualBox 5, but any other Linux distribution will work as well. Vagrant, Terraform,
the Chef Development Kit, and Docker also work on the Windows platform, although this is
untested by the authors.
As we're dealing with Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) here, also required are valid accounts
with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, Digital Ocean, Packet, Heroku, or an
OpenStack deployment.
Through the various chapters of this book, we'll also use free Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
accounts such as GitHub, Travis CI, Docker Hub, Quay.io, Hosted Chef, and StatusCake.
